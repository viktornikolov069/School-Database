# School-Database
HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

This application is built using C++11 and Visual Studio 2019. It uses text files and data structures to store the data entered on the command line. All the data is kept simultaneously in the text files and in the data structures inside the program. In the beginning of the program all the data from the text files is transferred to the data structures. Changes to the text files are being made while the program works so the data is saved if the program suddenly stops.

WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES

Console application that has register and login sections for different types of users (teacher, student, admin). Each user has different options to choose from inside the login section. Example of an option inside the login section is "1. Show User Info" or "2. Add Grade".
